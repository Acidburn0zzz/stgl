stgl - (ex) simple terminal (OpenGL edition!)
---------------------------------------------
stgl is a terminal emulator for X which sucks more than the original st,
but it's got neat fire effects!.

Configuration
-------------
See config.h for font configuration, and the header of rendering.cpp for feel
factor configuration.


Requirements
------------
In order to build stgl you need the Xlib header files and a libGL implementation.
You'll also need GLM.

In order to run stlgl you will need a reasonably modern graphics card with
OpenGL 4.5 support.

Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
